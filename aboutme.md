title: About me
---

I am Dimitris Paxinos, I am from Greece and I have been a professional developer for the last 6 years. I currently live and work in Hamburg, Germany.

My focus is on building Line-of-Business applications. I enjoy both front and back-end development and these days, I mainly develop using C# and technologies such as WPF, ASP.NET MVC, Web Api, Entity Framework. 

This blog was mainly created so that I can document some of the things I do, try or read about. Since I am generally interested in the whole software development process, I will try to cover some of its various aspects in the coming blog posts.

If you feel like contacting me, you can always drop me an [email](mailto:dpaxinos@gmail.com).

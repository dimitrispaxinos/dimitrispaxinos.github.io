title: About me
---

My name is Dimitris Paxinos, I am from Greece and I have been a professional software developer for the last 9 years. 

My focus is on building Line-of-Business applications. I enjoy both front and backend development and these days, I mainly develop using C# and technologies such as WPF, ASP.NET MVC, Web Api, Entity Framework. 

This blog was mainly created so that I can document some of the things I do, try or read about. Since I am generally interested in the whole software development process, I will try to cover some of its various aspects in the coming blog posts.

If you feel like contacting me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrispaxinos/) or drop me an [email](mailto:dpaxinos@gmail.com).

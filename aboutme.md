title: About me
---

My name is Dimitris Paxinos, I am from Greece and I like solving business problems with technology.

With more than 10 years of experience in coding, I would consider myself a [product minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) full stack developer since I care both about my code and the final product.

This blog was mainly created so that I can document some of the things I do, try out or read about. Since I am generally interested in the whole software development process, I will try to cover some of its various aspects in my blog posts.

If you feel like contacting me, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrispaxinos/) or drop me an [email](mailto:dpaxinos@gmail.com).

title: About me
---

I am Dimitris Paxinos, I am from Greece and I have been a professional developer for the last 6 years. I currently live and work in Hamburg, Germany.

I enjoy both front and back-end development and I mostly develop using C# and the .NET Framework at the moment. 

I created this blog in order to mainly document some of the things that I do, try or read about. Since I am generally interested in the whole software development process, I will also try to cover some of its various aspects in the coming blog posts.

This blog is under construction at the moment, so please bear with me for a while... ;-)

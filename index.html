                Centralized & Structured .NET Logging with Serilog & Seq Part 1
            </a>
        </h1>
        <span class="post-date">November 01, 2015</span>
        <h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Serilog and Seq are two open-source tools that can help you introduce a centralized and structured logging mechanism in your .NET application really quickly. Has a quick learning curve and can substantially improve your logging, monitoring and error reporting workflow.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The traditional approach of plain-text file based logging has some very important drawbacks. Log files have to be physically retrieved first and their contents have to subsequently be parsed into a structured form so that we can draw some useful conclusions. </p>

<p>Retrieving the log file when dealing with a web application is not that hard you might say. What happens if you have a client-server application? How are you going to get the client log files? </p>

<p>In the enterprise world, where LOB applications run in the intranet, the helpdesk could remotely connect to the computer where the client is running and retrieve the log file. But still... this could be better... </p>

<h2>Serilog &amp; Seq for the win</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we are going to start examining a different logging approach which offers:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li> Structured meaningful logging objects</li>
<li>A central repository for collecting these logs </li>
<li>A neat web interface with a queryable log list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>using two open-source tools, Serilog and Seq. The goal is to get from reading to trying it out very fast. </p>

<h3>What is Serilog?</h3>

<p><a href="http://serilog.net/">Serilog</a> is a logging .NET library like Log4Net which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Logs structured event data. (complete JSON objects) </li>
<li>Has a very clean and straightforward syntax. </li>
<li>Can write the logs to many different places (the so-called <a href="https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Provided-Sinks">Sinks</a>) like files, the console, DBs etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Seq?</h3>

<p><a href="http://getseq.net/">Seq</a> is a complete solution for storing, displaying and querying structured event data which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can be installed in a matter of minutes</li>
<li>Works out of the box with Serilog</li>
<li>Has an API for the logs to be submitted</li>
<li>Has a web interface with a queryable log list</li>
<li>Has some other cool features like retention and event triggers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let&#39;s try it out!</h2>

<h3>Installing Seq</h3>

<ol>
<li>Get Seq from <a href="http://getseq.net/Download">here</a> and do a default install </li>
<li>You can now access the web interface here: <a href="http://localhost:5341/#/events">http://localhost:5341/#/events</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Serilog Basics</h3>

<p>Fire up Visual Studio, create a console application and...</p>

<h4>NuGet packages</h4>

<p>Add the following two NuGet packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Serilog</li>
<li>Serilog.Sinks.Seq</li>
</ul>

<h4>Create Logger</h4>

<p>It is amazingly easy to create a logger that would write to our Seq server:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dimitrispaxinos/f34abc870cf39a27e5de.js"></script></p>

<h4>Publish a log event - Log Event Levels</h4>

<p>Publishing a log is as easy as using one line of code. You can use any of the following logging levels:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dimitrispaxinos/b3571ae6f3f6b48156c9.js"></script></p>

<p>And this is what you would see on the Seq web interface:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitrispaxinos/dimitrispaxinos.github.io/master/_assets/images/CentralizedStructuredLogging/SeqScreenShot_2.png" alt=""></p>

<h4>Attaching Parameters</h4>

<p>Let&#39;s now attach some parameters to our log event and make it a bit more meaningful:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dimitrispaxinos/ed1b50385e3b71ec6d8d.js"></script></p>

<p>The two parameters will be included in the logging event object as two additional properties with property names as declared in the log event string, <code>{FirstName}</code> and <code>{LastName}</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitrispaxinos/dimitrispaxinos.github.io/master/_assets/images/CentralizedStructuredLogging/SeqScreenShot_3.png" alt=""></p>

<h4>Attaching Structured Objects</h4>

<p>As said earlier, one of the strengths of Serilog is its ability to serialize and attach complete structured objects in its log event:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dimitrispaxinos/7e0c9389e98a845b9938.js"></script></p>

<p>As you can see below, you have to prefix your property name with &#39;@&#39; in order to be automatically serialized by Serilog:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitrispaxinos/dimitrispaxinos.github.io/master/_assets/images/CentralizedStructuredLogging/SeqScreenShot_4.png" alt=""></p>

<h4>Attaching an Exception</h4>

<p>Since we can attach stuctured objects, exceptions can also be attached:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/dimitrispaxinos/ba50c81dae503f17b905.js"></script></p>

<p>and also highlighted in red within Seq:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitrispaxinos/dimitrispaxinos.github.io/master/_assets/images/CentralizedStructuredLogging/SeqScreenShot_5.PNG" alt=""></p>

<h3>Summing-up Part 1</h3>

<p>In this first part, we went through the basics of using Serilog and Seq. The goal was to get you quickly up and running so that you can try it out yourself.  In Part 2, we will go through the contextual logging capabilities of Serilog, always in conjunction with Seq.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>An easy-to-read book with a wide target audience covering the core aspects of web usability, describing the complete process of usability testing and providing stimulation for further reading.</p>

<h3>Why this book?</h3>

<p>Steve Krug&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/">Don&#39;t make me think (Revisited)</a>  is among the most popular books regarding web usability. It has been on my to-read list for quite some time. After reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/">Steve Job&#39;s biography</a>*, it was simply the only book I could think of as my next read. </p>

<h3>General Feeling</h3>

<p>I will start with its size (approximately 200 pages) which is a huge plus for me since I generally do not like long books. If we now proceed to the book&#39;s content,  it is absolutely obvious that the author generally knows what usability means since he wrote a really usable book!</p>

<p>It is easy to read without getting tiring at any point.  It uses a lot of tables, diagrams  and pictures in order to visualize a lot of information making the whole reading experience really pleasant.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>The flow of the book is easy to follow. It is divided into four sections covering:</p>

<ol>
<li>The basic guiding usability principles according to the user&#39;s usual behavior and expectations.</li>
<li>The things that definitely have to be done right when creating a web site like navigation and right positioning of information within the page.</li>
<li>Usability Testing by describing the complete process.</li>
<li>Mobile usability, accessibility and ways of convincing upper management to invest in
usability testing.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What I think...</h3>

<p>As said earlier, this book is a nice read. It talks about and analyzes aspects of web design and usability that people often miss or neglect despite the fact that they are so obvious. I have already found some improvements that can be done in this blog as well.</p>

<p>It also talks you through the process of usability testing and how you can do it with minimal cost without having to outsource it. This might be extremely useful for companies with limited financial resources like startups.</p>

<p>The only part of the book that did not come up to my expectations was the mobile usability chapter which was really short and only scratched the surface of the topic.</p>

<p>To sum up, in my humble opinion, the book&#39;s main goal is to give you an overview of web usability and the basic rules that have to be followed in order to have an acceptably usable web site. The author keeps stimulating the reader and recommending books for digging deeper into specific aspects of usability.</p>

<h3>Who should read it?</h3>

<p>The beauty of this book is that, thanks to the way it was written, has a really wide target audience like product managers, web designers and developers. Therefore, anyone professionally involved in UI development from any position and anyone with an affinity for user interface design and usability would definitely benefit from reading this book.</p>

<p>*<em>Usability and perfect user experience were two of the core passions of  Steve Jobs throughout his life and also two of the core characteristics of all the products he introduced.</em></p>

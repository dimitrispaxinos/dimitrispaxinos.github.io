[This](http://contra.gr) is just a test blog post...

> I am trying out some stuff.

It's quite easy to learn how this works.

*This is **C#** Code Sample:*

```csharp
public class Contact
{
	public string FirstName {get;set;}
	//this is a comment
	public string LastName {get;set;}
}
```



```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

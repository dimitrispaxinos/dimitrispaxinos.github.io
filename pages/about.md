# **About Me**
<br>

Hi, I am **Dimitris** :wave:, I love tech and I use it to solve real business problems. 
With more than 10 years of experience in coding, I consider myself a [product minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) software developer since I care both about my code and the final product. 

I am currently working full-time as an IT Auditor at the Central Bank of Greece auditing and supervising the IT functions of financial institutions in both Greece and the EU. I am also involved in the FinTech scene as a member 
of the Bankâ€™s [FinTech Innovation Hub](https://www.bankofgreece.gr/en/main-tasks/supervision/fintech-innovation-hub) 
helping startups and other FinTech players regarding regulatory issues and queries. 

In parallel with my day job, I build things as a freelance developer. [13033](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=metakinisi.app&hl=en), an Android app I built, helped more than 6.5k people in Greece during the COVID-19 lockdown and was featured on the [Greek press](https://www.thetoc.gr/koinwnia/article/koronoios-13033---i-dorean-efarmogi-pou-stelnei-ta-sms-metakinisis-me-3-klik/). 
You can have a look at some of my other projects in the [Projects](https://www.dpaxinos.com/projects/) section. 

I also have entrepreneurial aspirations, therefore, I am co-organizing the 
[Athens Indie Hackers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Athens-Indie-Hackers-Meetups/) interacting with people running or trying to start bootstrap businesses. 
This is also my goal, to eventually start my own SaaS business.

This blog was mainly created so that I can document some of the things I build, try out or read about.

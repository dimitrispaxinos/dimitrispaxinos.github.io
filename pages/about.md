# **About Me**
<br>

Hi, I am **Dimitris** :wave:, a software engineer and entrepreneur.

With more than 12 years of experience in coding, I consider myself a 
[product minded](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/) software developer caring for both my code and the final product. 

I started my entrepreneurial journey two years ago by founding a small boutique software consultancy, [Apptiva Software](https://apptivasoftware.com) where we help our clients bring their app ideas to life or build internal line-of-business software that saves them time and money.   

Building apps is also a hobby of mine. [13033](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=metakinisi.app&hl=en), is one of my not-for-profit apps which helped more than 25.000 people in Greece during the COVID-19 lockdown and was featured on the [Greek press](https://www.thetoc.gr/koinwnia/article/koronoios-13033---i-dorean-efarmogi-pou-stelnei-ta-sms-metakinisis-me-3-klik/). 

You can have a look at some of my other projects in the [Projects](https://www.dpaxinos.com/projects/) section. 

On top of all that, I am also co-organizing the 
[Athens Indie Hackers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Athens-Indie-Hackers-Meetups/) interacting with people running or trying to start bootstrap businesses. 

This blog was mainly created so that I can document some of the things I build, try out or read about.
